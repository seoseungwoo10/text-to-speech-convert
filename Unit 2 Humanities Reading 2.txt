Unit 2 Humanities READING 2
Students in a stress management class were shown a glass of water by their psychology professor and asked how heavy it was. Students gave their answers, but the professor stopped them and told them the absolute weight of the glass didn’t matter. Instead, students needed to think of how the weight would change depending on how long they held it. The professor said that a glass held for a minute would feel light, but a glass held for a day straight would feel much heavier. The students thought about it and agreed. Then, the professor continued, “The longer you hold onto stress, the heavier it feels. If you still feel the weight of stress from the day before, it’s a sign that you should put the glass down.”
