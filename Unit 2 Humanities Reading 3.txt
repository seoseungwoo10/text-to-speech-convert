Unit 2 Humanities READING 3
Human beings have come a long way. 6,000 years ago, most people worked as farmers. They didn’t need to keep track of time like we do today because they were able to use the sun and seasons. They spent their days moving their animals and looking for places to find food. Over time, more people started to live in settlements. This new way of life also meant that they needed to keep track of time better. Priests, for example, had to know the exact time for religious celebrations. So the clock was invented to help people measure time. Clocks have been important ever since. Still today, clocks are useful tools that measure and track time. We use clocks for things like airport timetables. They are necessary to make sure planes don’t crash into each other in the air or on the ground.
