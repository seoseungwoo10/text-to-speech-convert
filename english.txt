Unit 2 Humanities Reading 1 
Speaking multiple languages is challenging. Ying moved to Hermsdorf, Germany in 2015. She began every conversation by saying “I’m sorry, my German is still not very good.” This told German speakers that she was not fluent and might not catch everything they said. It was a request that they speak more slowly and clearly to help her understand. She continued this for almost a decade. Recently, Ying went to a job interview and apologized for her less-than-perfect German. To her surprise, one interviewer was confused by her remark and said her German was quite good. Ying wondered, even if her German wasn’t perfect, did it matter? A couple of hours after the interview, she got called back to meet the CEO. This time, she didn’t say anything about her German skills. Later, she was offered the job. After reflecting on it, she realized that striving for perfection was setting unrealistic standards for herself.
